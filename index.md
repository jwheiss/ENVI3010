#### Course Objective
The objective of this course is to provide a theoretical and practical introduction to Geographic Information Systems (GIS). The course entails basic concepts and applications of GIS through examination of topics including geospatial data, data management, spatial reference systems, geodesy, map projections, interpolation, analytic toolboxes, and cartographic design. The ESRIâ€™s ArcGIS will be used extensively during class and for laboratory assignments. The course emphasizes practical application and laboratory exercises and is heavily hands-on.
